`insightface: The core library for face detection, alignment, and recognition using pretrained ArcFace models (MobileFaceNet is a lightweight backbone variant, but insightface uses efficient ArcFace-based models auto-downloaded on first run; it's optimized for real-time use and very similar in architecture/purpose to pure MobileFaceNet).`

pip install insightface==0.7.3

# Install directly from the wheel URL (pip handles the download):
pip install https://github.com/Gourieff/Assets/raw/main/Insightface/insightface-0.7.3-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl

# OR

Install Microsoft C++ Build Tools

`onnxruntime: Runtime for executing ONNX models (insightface uses ONNX format for CPU/GPU inference). On Windows, this is CPU-only by default; for GPU, you'd need CUDA setup, but we'll stick to CPU for simplicity.`

pip install onnxruntime

`opencv-python: For camera access, image capture, and basic processing (e.g., displaying video feed).`

pip install opencv-python

`numpy: For numerical operations on embeddings (face feature vectors).`

pip install numpy

`pickle-mixin: For saving/loading the face database (embeddings) to/from a file. (Note: Standard pickle is built-in, but this ensures compatibility.)`

pip install pickle-mixin

` DEPRECATION: Building 'pickle-mixin' using the legacy setup.py bdist_wheel mechanism, which will be removed in a future version. pip 25.3 will enforce this behaviour change. A possible replacement is to use the standardized build interface by setting the `--use-pep517` option, (possibly combined with `--no-build-isolation`), or adding a `pyproject.toml` file to the source tree of 'pickle-mixin'. Discussion can be found at https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/6334`
